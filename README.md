# Guitar-Easy-Peasy-Web-App 
<strong>Your One-Stop Shop for Local Guitar Lessons and Enhanced Learning</strong>


---

## Aim
Streamline the search for qualified guitar instructors, simplify the learning process, and empower guitar enthusiasts of all skill levels.

## Motivation and About Myself
As a passionate guitarist since the age of 10, countless hours were spent honing my skills, passing music exams with merit (Trinity College London Grade Exams), competing, and even winning music competitions. Transitioning into engineering gave me a new perspective and motivated me to create an app to solve the frustrations I experienced finding the right guitar teacher.  Endless searches, demo sessions, and wasted resources highlighted a clear need for a better solution. This experience sparked my desire to create Guitar-Easy-Peasy, an app that empowers guitar enthusiasts by streamlining the learning process and fostering a more accessible and engaging musical community for all.
